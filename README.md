# MHConstructor
# Project Background
Pipeline description: [MHConstructor: a high-throughput, haplotype-informed solution to the MHC assembly challenge](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03412-6)

# What is MHC, and why does it matter to neurodegenerative disease?
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), the most polymorphic region of the human genome, encodes human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that play a key role in innate immunity and have been strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the brainâ€™s resident immune cells, are regulated by MHC signaling, and when overactivated, contribute to neuroinflammation and disease progression. However, the specific mechanisms and causal variants mediating this response remain poorly understood. 

# Why do we need MHConstructor?
Due to its complex structure, marked by high heterozygosity and structural variation, the MHC region is challenging to sequence with traditional reference-based tools. To address this, our collaborators in the Hollenbach lab at UCSF have developed [MHConstructor](https://github.com/Hollenbach-lab/MHConstructor), a novel tool that enables reference-free, de novo assembly of the MHC locus, allowing detection of variants that are not represented in current reference genomes.
